# ⭐ Star Classification using XGBoost ⭐

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on classifying stars based on various astronomical features using machine learning techniques, primarily **XGBoost**. The dataset contains information such as spectral characteristics, magnitudes, and other relevant parameters. The goal is to build an accurate classification model to differentiate between different types of stars.


## 🛠️ Steps Followed  

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing  
- ✅ Loaded the dataset containing star characteristics.  
- ✅ Handled missing values and cleaned the data.  
- ✅ Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features.  
- ✅ Scaled and normalized numerical features for optimal model performance.  

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering  
- ✅ Selected relevant features for training the model.  
- ✅ Encoded categorical variables (if any).  
- ✅ Created new derived features (if applicable).  

### 3️⃣ Model Selection & Training  
- ✅ Implemented **XGBoost**, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm.  
- ✅ Tuned hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV**.  
- ✅ Split the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate performance.  

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation  
- ✅ Used metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix** to evaluate performance.  
- ✅ Compared results with baseline models like **Naïve Bayes (NB)** for benchmarking.  

### 5️⃣ Model Saving & Deployment  
- ✅ Saved the trained model using **Pickle (`.pkl`)** for future use.  
- ✅ Provided a Jupyter Notebook (`star_classification_NB.ipynb`) for reproducibility.  


### 📦 Dependencies:  
- ✔️ Python 3.x  
- ✔️ Pandas  
- ✔️ NumPy  
- ✔️ XGBoost  
- ✔️ Scikit-learn  
- ✔️ Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)  

## 🚀 Running the Project  
1️⃣ Open `star_classification_NB.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2️⃣ Run all the cells to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.  
3️⃣ Load the saved model (`star_classification.pkl`) to make predictions on new data.  

## 📊 Results & Findings  
- ✅ **XGBoost outperformed other models** with high accuracy and robust classification performance.  
- ✅ **Feature importance analysis** provided insights into which attributes contributed most to classification.  
- ✅ **The final trained model is saved** for future use.  

## 🔮 Future Scope  
- 🚀 Implement deep learning-based approaches for better accuracy.  
- 🚀 Improve hyperparameter tuning strategies.  
- 🚀 Deploy the model as a web application for interactive classification.
